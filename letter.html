  <h1>Happy Valentine's Day Dee! <br></h1>
  <h2> dear Dee, </h2>
<p>
Divine,
  out of all the gifts <br>
  that I have given you this has got <br>
   to be by far one of my favorites and i hopw it becomes yours too. <br>

I don’t know when it happened.
I don’t know how.
All I know is that somewhere between the small moments and the quiet ones,
you became my favorite thought.

You are the first thing on my mind when I wake up
and the last thing I think about before I sleep.
Loving you isn’t something I try to do —
it just happens, over and over again, without effort.

I get jealous.
I get protective.
I get obsessed.
Not because I don’t trust you,
but because the idea of a world where you aren’t mine
has never made sense to me.

This little website could never hold everything I feel for you,
but it’s my way of saying this:
you are chosen.
Every day.
In every version of the future I imagine.

Happy Valentine’s Day, Divine.
You’re stuck with me — and I wouldn’t have it any other way. ❤️
</p>
      Love, T
